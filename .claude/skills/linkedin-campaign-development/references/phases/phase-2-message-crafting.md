# Phase 2: Message Crafting (Identity-First)

## Purpose

Write personalized messages using the Identity-First methodology. This is the CORE of the skill - messages that make recipients think "they really get me."

## The Identity-First Philosophy

Most outreach focuses on **WHAT people did** (achievements, awards, milestones). These prove research was done.

Messages that resonate deeply focus on **WHO they are** (values, mission, philosophy, the thread connecting their choices). These create **CONNECTION**.

## The Core Pattern

```
{identity insight}; {warm validation}; {identity-aligned AI opportunity}
```

### Pattern Components

1. **Identity Insight** - Single COMPELLING observation about THEM (not their company)
   - "Noticed you describe yourself as captain, coach and cheerleader..."
   - "Saw you took your customer intelligence expertise from gambling to help students..."
   - "Saw you're the official Buurtzorg rep bringing nurse-led care to Australia..."

2. **Warm Validation** - Short, genuine acknowledgment (NOT over-the-top praise)
   - Semicolon connection: `;` reads more naturally than em-dashes
   - Keep it brief: the observation itself is the validation

3. **Identity-Aligned AI Opportunity** - Question framing that makes them the hero
   - "what if AI could..."
   - "do you think there could be an opportunity..."
   - Specific to their domain and challenges
   - Makes THEM the person who could bring it to life

## Writing Style Guide (Critical)

LinkedIn is person-to-person, not marketing copy. Write like you're talking to someone at a coffee shop.

### DO:
- Start with "Saw your...", "Noticed you...", "Congrats on..."
- Use semicolons to join related thoughts
- Say "I think" or "I reckon"
- Keep sentences short and punchy
- Use simple words ("avoid" not "mitigate", "use" not "leverage")

### NEVER:
- Em-dashes (-) - dead giveaway an LLM wrote it
- Emojis or smileys - unprofessional for exec-level outreach
- Marketing speak - no "unlock", "leverage", "synergy", "game-changer"
- Complex sentence structures - if you need a comma, consider splitting
- Superlatives - no "amazing", "incredible", "groundbreaking"
- TM, (R), or superscript characters

## Fact Quality Hierarchy

The fact you choose matters more than anything. A boring fact kills the message.

**Hierarchy (Best to Worst):**

1. **Their Own Words** - Quote their self-description from About section
   - Shows you actually READ their profile deeply

2. **Their Reputation** - What others say about them (recommendations)
   - Uses social proof, validates their expertise

3. **Their Purpose/Values** - Career pivots that reveal what they care about
   - Highlights meaning, not just job titles

4. **Unique Achievements** - Specific accomplishments only THEY can claim
   - Sets them apart from generic observations

5. **Recent Activity** - Posts, articles, announcements
   - Shows you follow their thinking

**AVOID (Boring Facts):**
- Job tenure alone ("9 years as COO...")
- Company names stacked ("background from RODE and Sunbeam...")
- Generic titles ("leading product design at...")
- Multiple facts combined (instant credibility killer)

## Examples by Identity Type

### Using Their Own Words (Best)
```
Noticed you describe yourself as captain, coach and cheerleader for great customer experiences; what if AI could surface product feedback patterns so your team focuses on what customers actually need?
```
*Why it works: Quotes their self-description, shows deep profile reading*

### Using Their Reputation
```
Saw you're known for conceptually strong information design that communicates brilliantly at executive levels; what if AI could transform complex lending data into visual stories that sell themselves?
```
*Why it works: Uses what others say about them, validates their expertise*

### Highlighting Purpose/Values
```
Saw you took your customer intelligence expertise from gambling to help students succeed at Cluey; what if AI could predict which tutoring approaches work best for each learner's style?
```
*Why it works: Emphasizes meaningful career pivot, not just job history*

### Industry Pioneer
```
Saw you're the official Buurtzorg rep bringing nurse-led care to Australia; do you think there could be an opportunity to use AI to help self-managing teams spot care patterns early?
```
*Why it works: Unique position only they hold, mission-driven*

### Unique Achievement
```
Saw you've chaired the Spark Design Awards jury for over a decade; what if AI could help your team spot emerging design trends before competitors?
```
*Why it works: Specific accomplishment that sets them apart*

## Examples by Industry

### Mining/Resources
```
Saw you delivered Onslow ahead of time and under budget; what if AI could predict equipment failures before they cost you contracts?
```

### Healthcare/NDIS
```
Noticed you're scaling disability services across multiple regions; what if AI could match participants with support workers based on goals and preferences?
```

### Finance/Fintech
```
Saw you've been leading product at a lending platform; what if AI could give SMEs instant indicative credit decisions from their banking data?
```

### Agency/Marketing
```
Very impressive how you've built a people-first culture for 11 years; what if AI could flag at-risk accounts before client issues escalate?
```

### Legal/Professional Services
```
Noticed your 10 transformation certifications including Stanford Innovation; what if AI could predict case complexity from intake so your team routes work before backlogs build?
```

## AI Opportunity Framing Rules

1. **Role-Appropriate** - Match the opportunity to their actual role
   - CEO doesn't "handle queries" - their team does
   - COO focuses on operations, not sales strategy

2. **Question Framing** - Invites curiosity, doesn't prescribe
   - "what if AI could..." (opens possibility)
   - NOT "AI can help you..." (prescriptive)

3. **Specific to Domain** - Generic opportunities don't resonate
   - "predict equipment failures" (specific)
   - NOT "improve efficiency" (generic)

4. **Single Opportunity** - Never stack multiple AI ideas
   - Pick the ONE most relevant

5. **Make Them the Hero** - Position them as the person who brings it to life
   - Their expertise + AI = impact

## Pre-Send Checklist

Before finalizing each message:

- [ ] Contains only ONE verifiable fact (not multiple claims)
- [ ] Fact is easily deducible from their profile data
- [ ] Ends with a question ("what if..." or "do you think...")
- [ ] AI opportunity is specific to their domain/challenge
- [ ] AI opportunity matches their ROLE (CEO vs COO vs Director)
- [ ] No em-dashes, no emojis, no marketing speak
- [ ] No TM, (R), or superscript characters
- [ ] Sounds like genuine curiosity, not a sales pitch
- [ ] Uses semicolons, not em-dashes for joining thoughts

## Output Format

```json
{
  "firstName": "Greg",
  "lastName": "Barclay",
  "personalisedMessage": "Noticed your 10 transformation certifications including Stanford Innovation; what if AI could help Slater and Gordon predict case complexity from intake so your team routes work before backlogs build?",
  "messageRationale": "Identity-First: Led with professional development identity (transformation expert with Stanford credential). AI opportunity aligned with legal workflow optimization relevant to Transformation Director role during organizational change period."
}
```

## Common Mistakes

1. **Achievement over Identity** - "Congrats on 9 years as COO" vs "Saw you built a zero-turnover team"
2. **Company over Person** - Facts about the company, not about THEM
3. **Wrong Role Assumption** - CEO handling queries, Director making sales calls
4. **Em-dash Slippage** - Using - instead of semicolons
5. **Multiple Facts** - Stacking observations kills credibility
6. **Generic Opportunities** - "improve efficiency" says nothing
7. **Old Achievements** - 2021 award in 2025 feels stale unless it's defining

## Next Phase

Once messages are drafted, proceed to **Phase 3: Quality Assurance** for Perplexity full-context validation and pilot user review.
