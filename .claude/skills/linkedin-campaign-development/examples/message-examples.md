---

## Pattern Reminder

```
{identity insight}; {warm validation}; {identity-aligned AI opportunity}
```

Or simplified:
```
{fact}; {AI opportunity question}
```

---

## Examples by Identity Type

### 1. Their Own Words (Best Quality)

**Lead**: COO describing themselves as "captain, coach and cheerleader for great customer experiences"

```
Noticed you describe yourself as captain, coach and cheerleader for great customer experiences; what if AI could surface product feedback patterns so your team focuses on what customers actually need?
```

**Why it works:**
- Quotes their self-description verbatim
- Shows deep profile reading (About section)
- AI opportunity aligns with customer experience focus

---

### 2. Their Reputation

**Lead**: Design Director known for "conceptually strong information design that communicates brilliantly at executive levels"

```
Saw you're known for conceptually strong information design that communicates brilliantly at executive levels; what if AI could transform complex lending data into visual stories that sell themselves?
```

**Why it works:**
- Uses what others say about them (recommendation)
- Validates their expertise through social proof
- AI opportunity connects their skill to a business outcome

---

### 3. Their Purpose/Values (Career Pivots)

**Lead**: Executive who moved from gambling industry to education tech

```
Saw you took your customer intelligence expertise from gambling to help students succeed at Cluey; what if AI could predict which tutoring approaches work best for each learner's style?

- Focuses on purpose, not just job history
- AI opportunity connects to new mission

---

### 4. Unique Position

**Lead**: The only official Buurtzorg representative in Australia

```
Saw you're the official Buurtzorg rep bringing nurse-led care to Australia; do you think there could be an opportunity to use AI to help self-managing teams spot care patterns early?
```

**Why it works:**
- Unique position only they can claim
- Mission-driven framing
- Uses "do you think" for softer approach

---

### 5. Unique Achievement

**Lead**: Long-standing industry jury chair

```
Saw you've chaired the Spark Design Awards jury for over a decade; what if AI could help your team spot emerging design trends before competitors?
```

**Why it works:**
- Specific accomplishment with time element
- Sets them apart from generic observations
- AI connects to their domain expertise

---

```
Noticed you're scaling disability services across multiple regions; what if AI could match participants with support workers based on goals and preferences?

---

### Engineering/Consulting

```

### Sustainability/ESG

```

```

**Pattern**: Current activity (hiring) → Measurement/proof opportunity

---

## Common Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

### Stacking Multiple Facts (BAD)

```
Saw you've been COO for 9 years, previously at RODE and Sunbeam, now leading operations at Allbirds with expansion to 5 countries; what if AI could help optimize your supply chain?
```

**Why it fails:**
- Too many facts stacked
- Reads like a research dump
- No single compelling insight

**Fixed version:**
```
Saw you scaled Allbirds to 5 countries; what if AI could predict regional inventory needs before stockouts hurt sales?
```

---

### Em-Dash Slippage (BAD)

```
Your post about delivering Onslow ahead of time/under budget while building a zero-turnover team says it all - now at Axis, one opportunity might be using AI to turn existing fleet telemetry into predictive maintenance decisions before downtime costs contracts.
```

**Why it fails:**
- Em-dashes are LLM giveaway
- Too long and complex
- Multiple ideas crammed together

**Fixed version:**
```
Saw your post about building a zero-turnover team at Onslow; I think an opportunity now at Axis might be using AI to turn existing fleet telemetry into predicting maintenance decisions to avoid downtime.
```

---

### Wrong Role Assumption (BAD)

```
Saw you're CEO of both companies; what if AI could handle routine customer queries across both so you focus on growth strategy?
```

**Why it fails:**
- CEOs don't handle customer queries
- Implies wrong level of involvement
- Suggests they're doing staff work

**Fixed version:**
```
Saw you're running both Macarthur Baskets and Hampers With Bite; what if AI could give you a single dashboard view across both companies so you spot issues before they become problems?
```

---

### Generic Opportunity (BAD)

```
Saw you're leading digital transformation; what if AI could improve your operational efficiency?
```

**Why it fails:**
- "Improve efficiency" is meaningless
- Could apply to anyone
- No domain specificity

**Fixed version:**
```
Noticed your 10 transformation certifications including Stanford Innovation; what if AI could predict case complexity from intake so your team routes work before backlogs build?
```
