# Worktree Manager Skill

Complete worktree lifecycle management for parallel development environments with isolated ports, databases, and configuration.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user wants to:
- **Create** a new worktree for parallel development
- **Remove** an existing worktree
- **List** all worktrees and their status
- **Check** worktree configuration or status
- **Manage** multiple parallel development environments

**Do NOT use this skill when:**
- User asks for a specific subagent or skill delegation
- User wants to manually use git commands directly
- The task is unrelated to worktree management

## Operations Overview

This skill manages three core worktree operations:

| Operation | Command | When to Use |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Create** | `/create_worktree` | User wants a new parallel environment |
| **List** | `/list_worktrees` | User wants to see existing worktrees |
| **Remove** | `/remove_worktree` | User wants to delete a worktree |

## Orchestrator Worktree Launch

For launching orchestrator sessions with proper isolation, use the `launchorchestrator` shell function:

```bash
# Add to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
launchorchestrator() {
    local initiative_name="${1:-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)}"
    local worktree_dir="../orchestrator-${initiative_name}"

    # Create worktree
    git worktree add "$worktree_dir" -b "orchestrator/${initiative_name}"

    # Launch Claude with orchestrator style
    cd "$worktree_dir"
    export CLAUDE_SESSION_DIR="$initiative_name"
    claude --output-style=orchestrator
}
```

### Usage

```bash
# With custom initiative name
launchorchestrator epic-auth-system

# With auto-generated timestamp name
launchorchestrator
```

### What This Does

1. Creates a git worktree for isolated development
2. Exports `CLAUDE_SESSION_DIR` for session isolation
3. Launches Claude with `--output-style=orchestrator` which:
   - Establishes orchestrator mindset (investigate yourself, delegate implementation)
   - Invokes the `orchestrator-multiagent` skill automatically
   - Provides the 4-phase pattern (Ideation → Planning → Execution → Validation)

### Related Alias

For launching workers inside tmux sessions, use `launchcc`:

```bash
alias launchcc='claude --chrome --dangerously-skip-permissions'
```

Workers use `launchcc` (not `claude`) so they can edit files autonomously without manual approval.

## Decision Tree: Which Command to Use

### 1. User wants to CREATE a worktree
**Keywords:** create, new, setup, make, build, start, initialize
**Action:** Use `/create_worktree <branch-name> [port-offset]`

### 2. User wants to LIST worktrees
**Keywords:** list, show, display, what, which, status, check, view
**Action:** Use `/list_worktrees`

### 3. User wants to REMOVE a worktree
**Keywords:** remove, delete, cleanup, destroy, stop, kill, terminate
**Action:** Use `/remove_worktree <branch-name>`

## Quick Start

For step-by-step operation instructions, see [OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md).

For detailed examples and usage patterns, see [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md).

For troubleshooting and common issues, see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

For technical details and quick reference, see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md).

## Important Notes

### Do NOT attempt to:
- Create worktrees manually with git commands
- Manually configure ports or environment files
- Use bash to remove directories directly
- Manage worktree processes manually

### Always use the slash commands because they:
- Handle all configuration automatically
- Ensure port uniqueness
- Validate operations
- Provide comprehensive error handling
- Clean up properly on removal
