## 4-Phase Pattern

The orchestrator follows a complete cycle for each feature:

```
1. PREPARATION
   ├── Read feature_list.json / bd ready
   ├── Run regression check (1-2 passing features)
   └── Select next ready feature

2. ASSIGNMENT
   ├── Determine worker type
   ├── Prepare worker context
   ├── Launch worker (tmux session)
   └── Set expectations

3. MONITORING
   ├── Check-ins (every 30-45 min)
   ├── Watch for red flags
   ├── Provide guidance if needed
   └── Detect completion signals

4. VALIDATION
   ├── Run feature validation command
   ├── Post-test verification (Explore agent)
   ├── Check scope compliance
   └── Decision: Accept / Reject / Escalate

5. PROGRESSION
   ├── Update feature_list.json (passes: true) / bd close
   ├── Commit to git
   ├── Update progress tracking
   └── Loop back to step 1
```

### Phase Details

**Preparation**: Ensure clean state and identify next actionable feature.
- Read state to understand current status
- Run regression check on 1-2 previously passing features
- Select first feature where dependencies are satisfied

**Assignment**: Delegate feature to appropriate worker with complete context.
- Match feature to specialist (frontend/backend/general)
- Provide context package with acceptance criteria, files, validation command
- Launch tmux session with clear expectations

**Monitoring**: Track progress, detect problems early.
- Periodic check-ins every 30-45 minutes
- Use Haiku sub-agent with `run_in_background=True` for context-efficient monitoring
- Watch for scope creep, TODO/FIXME, time exceeded

**Validation**: Verify feature works as designed, not just that tests pass.
- Pre-validation: git clean, scope compliance, no incomplete markers
- Run validation command (tests)
- Post-test validation via Explore agent (hollow test detection)

**Progression**: Record success, commit, prepare for next feature.
- Update state file (only the `passes` field)
- Commit with descriptive message
- Update progress tracking, document learnings
- Clean up worker session

---

## Autonomous Mode Protocol

Enable independent monitoring and completion of multiple features without user intervention.

### Autonomous Continuation Criteria

**Continue to next feature automatically when ALL conditions met:**

1. Current feature validation PASSED (all three levels)
2. `bd close <id>` completed with evidence in reason
3. Git commit successful with `feat(<id>)` message
4. `bd ready` returns next available task
5. No regressions detected in spot checks
6. Services remain healthy

### Stop Conditions (Report to User)

**Stop autonomous operation and report when ANY condition met:**

1. **3+ consecutive features blocked** - Indicates systemic issue
2. **Regression discovered** - Previously closed work now failing
3. **Service crash not auto-recoverable** - Infrastructure problem
4. **Uber-epic complete** - All epics closed, initiative done
5. **User explicitly requested checkpoint** - Honor user requests
6. **Circular dependency detected** - Beads graph issue
7. **Worker exceeds 2 hours on single task** - Decomposition needed

### Multi-Feature Session Loop

```
LOOP:
  1. PRE-FLIGHT CHECK
     - If not done this session: Run full PREFLIGHT.md checklist
     - If already done: Quick service health check only

  2. SELECT NEXT TASK
     bd ready → Pick highest priority unblocked task
     bd update <id> --status in_progress

  3. DELEGATE TO WORKER
     - Create tmux session: worker-<id>
     - Launch Claude Code interactively (no -p flag)
     - Paste worker assignment template
     - Launch Haiku monitor with run_in_background=True

  4. AWAIT COMPLETION
     TaskOutput(task_id=monitor_agent_id, block=True)

  5. VALIDATE (THREE LEVELS - ALL MANDATORY)
     See Validation Protocol below

  6. CLOSE OR REMEDIATE
     IF all validation passed:
       bd close <id> --reason "PASS: Unit ✓ API ✓ E2E ✓ [evidence]"
       git add . && git commit -m "feat(<id>): [description]"
       → CONTINUE LOOP

     IF validation failed:
       Document failure in scratch pad
       IF first failure: Provide worker feedback, retry
       IF second failure: Decompose task, create sub-beads
       IF third failure: STOP, report to user

  7. REGRESSION SPOT CHECK (every 3rd feature)
     Pick 1 recently closed bead
     Run its validation
     IF regression: bd reopen → STOP, report to user

  8. CHECK STOP CONDITIONS
     IF any stop condition met: Exit loop, report to user
     ELSE: → CONTINUE LOOP
```

### Validation Protocol (3-Level)

**All three levels are MANDATORY before closing any feature.**

#### Level 1: Unit Tests

**Backend (Python/pytest)**:
```bash
cd agencheck-support-agent
pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
```

**Frontend (TypeScript/Jest)**:
```bash
cd agencheck-support-frontend
npm run test -- --coverage
```

**Pass Criteria**: Zero test failures, no uncaught exceptions, coverage maintained.

#### Level 2: Integration/API Tests

**API Endpoint Validation**:
```bash
# Health checks
curl -s http://localhost:8000/health | jq .
curl -s http://localhost:5184/health | jq .
curl -s http://localhost:5185/health | jq .

# Feature-specific endpoints
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/agencheck \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "test message", "session_id": "test-123"}'
```

**Pass Criteria**: All endpoints return 200, response structures match schemas, data persists.

#### Level 3: E2E Browser Tests

Use Markdown-based test specifications:

1. **Test Specification** → Read from `__tests__/e2e/specs/J{N}-*.md`
2. **Worker Execution** → Execute via chrome-devtools MCP tools
3. **Execution Report** → Write to `__tests__/e2e/results/J{N}/J{N}_EXECUTION_REPORT.md`
4. **Orchestrator Review** → Sense-check results, re-execute if anomalies

**Pass Criteria**: UI renders correctly, workflows complete, no JS console errors, 100% pass rate.

## Feature Decomposition (MAKER)

**Reference:** "SOLVING A MILLION-STEP LLM TASK WITH ZERO ERRORS" paper

**Core Principle:** Decompose until each step is simple enough for a Haiku model to execute with high reliability.

### MAKER Checklist

Before adding ANY feature, ask these four questions:

| Question | If YES | If NO |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Can this be broken into smaller steps? | Decompose further | Proceed |
| Does each step modify multiple files? | Too broad, decompose | Proceed |
| Could a Haiku model complete each step? | Proceed | Too complex, decompose |
| Is there more than ONE decision per step? | Too complex, decompose | Proceed |

### Decision Tree

```
START: Evaluate feature candidate
    ↓
Is feature completable in ONE worker session?
    NO → Split into multiple features
    YES ↓
Does feature have 10+ validation steps?
    YES → Too large, split into smaller features
    NO ↓
Do validation steps include "and" or "then"?
    YES → Multiple tasks, split steps
    NO ↓
Does scope include 5+ files?
    YES → Too broad, reduce scope or split feature
    NO ↓
Is each step specific and verifiable?
    NO → Refine steps to be concrete
    YES ↓
✅ APPROVED: Add to feature list
```

### Red Flags

| Red Flag | Meaning | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Feature has 10+ steps | Too large | Split into multiple features |
| Step says "and" | Multiple tasks | Split into separate steps |
| Step is vague ("make it work") | Undefined | Specify exact outcome |
| Scope has 5+ files | Too broad | Reduce scope per feature |
| Description includes "how" details | Implementation details leaking | Focus on "what" behavior |
| Dependencies form circular chain | Logic error | Redesign feature order |

### Warning Signs During Execution

If you observe these during Phase 2, the decomposition needs improvement:

- Workers consistently exceed 2 hours per feature
- Workers modify files outside scope repeatedly
- Features fail validation 3+ times
- Workers spawn 10+ sub-agents for one feature
- Workers report "unclear requirements"

**Action:** Stop, return to Phase 1, refine decomposition.

### Good vs Bad Steps

**Good Steps:**
- "Add email input field to login form"
- "Create POST /api/auth endpoint"
- "Verify token returned in response body"
- "Display error message when email invalid"

**Bad Steps:**
- "Implement authentication" (too vague)
- "Build login form and connect to backend" (multiple tasks)
- "Make it work" (undefined outcome)
- "Fix any bugs" (open-ended)

tmux list-sessions | grep worker && echo "Kill worker sessions first"

# 2. Update state and commit
git add .claude/state/
git commit -m "feat(F00X): [description] - marked complete"

# 3. Update progress files
git add .claude/progress/
git commit -m "docs: update progress after F00X completion"

# 4. Verify clean state
git status
```

### Starting New Session

**When resuming orchestration work:**

1. **Load Context**
   ```bash
   cat .claude/progress/{project}-summary.md
   tail -100 .claude/progress/{project}-log.md
   ```

2. **Verify Environment**
   - [ ] Services status matches summary.md expectation
   - [ ] Git status clean, on correct branch

3. **Mandatory Regression Check**
   - Pick 1-2 features marked `passes: true`
   - Run their validation steps
   - If ANY fail → mark as `passes: false` and fix BEFORE proceeding

4. **Identify Next Feature**
   - Find next ready feature (passes == false, dependencies satisfied)
   - Check all dependencies have passes == true

5. **Begin Work**
   - Proceed to Phase 2 workflow
