# Parallel Architect Consensus Command

Execute the "Parallel Architect Consensus with Majority Voting Aggregation" methodology for complex solution design tasks.

## Execution Steps

### Phase 1: Context Preparation
1. Read all relevant business context and existing documentation
2. Review any PRDs or solution designs for patterns
3. Understand the problem space thoroughly

### Phase 2: Handoff Document Creation
Create comprehensive briefing document containing:
- Mission statement and business impact
- Proposed architecture overview
- Core components design
- Reference documentation
- Architect instructions with 7 diverse approaches
- Evaluation criteria

### Phase 3: Parallel Architect Deployment

Launch 7 solution-design-architect agents IN TRUE PARALLEL with these reasoning strategies:

```markdown
**CRITICAL**: Launch all architects in a single message with multiple Task tool calls for true parallelism

Architect 1 - First Principles: Break down to fundamental truths and rebuild
Architect 2 - Pattern Recognition: Apply known patterns from similar systems
Architect 3 - Systematic Decomposition: Divide into modules and interfaces
Architect 4 - Reverse Engineering: Work backwards from ideal outcome
Architect 5 - Constraint Analysis: Focus on limitations and work within them
Architect 6 - Probabilistic Reasoning: Evaluate multiple hypotheses with confidence scores
Architect 7 - Creative Exploration: Use analogies and unconventional approaches
```

Each architect receives:
- Identical context document
- Unique reasoning strategy requirement
- Standardized output format requirement

### Phase 4: Context Preservation
When approaching context limits, create consolidated document preserving:
- All 7 architect responses
- Common themes identification
- Divergent approaches analysis
- Key innovations from each

### Phase 5: Majority Voting Aggregation

Analyze responses for:
- **Unanimous Consensus (7/7)**: Core elements all architects agree on
- **Strong Majority (5-6/7)**: Widely supported features
- **Selected Innovations**: Best unique insights from each architect
- **Risk Patterns**: Common concerns across multiple architects

### Phase 6: Final Synthesis

Create comprehensive solution design document:
- Consensus architecture combining best elements
- Implementation roadmap with phases
- Success metrics and KPIs
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Testing and validation approach

## Key Success Factors

1. **Enforced Diversity**: Each architect MUST use assigned reasoning strategy
2. **True Parallelism**: Launch all architects simultaneously in single message
3. **No Cross-Contamination**: Architects work in isolation
4. **Standardized Output**: Enables systematic comparison
5. **Democratic Synthesis**: Not just voting, but understanding emergence patterns

## Example Invocation

```bash
# For a complex system design challenge
/parallel-solutioning "Design a real-time fraud detection system handling 1M transactions/second"

# For architecture refactoring
/parallel-solutioning "Migrate monolithic application to microservices with zero downtime"

# For integration challenges
/parallel-solutioning "Integrate 5 legacy systems into unified data platform"
```

## Expected Outcomes

- 7 diverse, comprehensive solution designs
- Consensus architecture with proven patterns
- Innovative approaches worth exploring
- Risk matrix with mitigation strategies
- Clear implementation roadmap
- Preserved context for future sessions

## Benefits

1. **Cognitive Diversity**: Prevents groupthink through enforced strategies
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Explores solution space from 7 angles
3. **Democratic Validation**: Identifies strongest patterns
4. **Innovation Preservation**: Captures unique insights
5. **Risk Mitigation**: Multiple perspectives identify different risks
6. **Context Continuity**: Enables seamless handoffs between sessions

## Important Notes

- This approach typically requires 30-45 minutes for full execution
- Best suited for complex, high-impact architectural decisions
- Creates significant documentation for future reference
- May approach context limits - be prepared to consolidate
- Results in production-ready solution designs

## Post-Execution

After running this command:
1. Review the synthesized solution design
2. Create Task Master tasks from the implementation roadmap
3. Begin implementation with highest-consensus elements first
4. Use innovative approaches for specific optimization opportunities
5. Document learnings for future parallel solutioning sessions
