WORKER ASSIGNMENT: J12 Thread Creation E2E Tests

Beads Task: agencheck-y1mm
Priority: P2
Type: E2E Test Spec Creation

GOALS:
Create comprehensive E2E test specification for thread creation and lifecycle workflows following the pattern established in J10 and J11.

ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA:
Functional Requirements:
- Given: User opens chat interface, When: First interaction occurs, Then: Thread created with lazy initialization
- Given: Thread UUID generated client-side, When: First message sent, Then: Thread persisted to database
- Given: Multiple threads created, When: Thread list retrieved, Then: All threads visible with correct metadata
- Given: Concurrent thread creation, When: Multiple tabs create threads, Then: No race conditions or duplicate IDs

Technical Requirements:
- Follow J10/J11 MD spec format exactly
- Use chrome-devtools MCP tool instructions (navigate_page, take_snapshot, click, fill, wait_for)
- Include validation criteria for each test scenario
- Document expected vs actual behavior
- Provide evidence directory structure

Testing Requirements:
- Minimum 5 test scenarios covering happy path and edge cases
- Each test must be executable via chrome-devtools MCP
- Include timeout recommendations
- Document common failure patterns

ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT:
- Reference Specs: agencheck-support-frontend/__tests__/e2e/specs/J10-ag-ui-contact-operations.md, J11-aura-orchestrator-flows.md
- Investigation Source: Serena memory e2e-testing-aura-orchestrator-investigation-2025-12-23
- Output Location: agencheck-support-frontend/__tests__/e2e/specs/J12-thread-creation-lifecycle.md
- Key Files to Review:
  - components/ThreadInitializer.tsx (frontend thread creation)
  - app/api/threads/route.ts (thread API proxy)
  - database/thread_storage.py (backend persistence)

Test Gaps to Address (from investigation):
1. Thread lazy creation (UUID generation)
2. First message triggers database persistence
3. Thread metadata accuracy (timestamps, message_count)
4. Thread list retrieval after creation
5. Concurrent thread creation (race conditions)

Create the J12 spec following the exact format of J10 and J11. When complete, update beads task status to in_progress, then create the spec file, then close the task.
